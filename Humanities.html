		<h1>Humanities</h1>
		<p class="footer">
			In Humanities with Mrs. Small, I was able to have my first experience
			of a combined history and English class. One aspect of the class that
			I enjoyed most was the discussions, which allowed myself and my peers
			to share our ideas about topics found in assigned readings, as well
			as anything else that we found interesting. The fact that these
			discussions were not completely rigid allowed for a more varied and
			interesting experience during class. Aside from the discussions and
			readings, much of the time in class was spent working on essays, and
			constantly improving our writing styles and ability to express
			ourselves. Two examples of these essays can be found below. We also
			had some more creative assignments. One of these was a skit about the
			book <i>Walden</i> by Henry David Thoreau, and we all were able to
			present these during Bournedale. This was a super fun time and I
			loved seeing some humorous skits and amazing acting from my peers. We
			also had some time to work on a satire piece with a group. This could
			be in the form of a video, new article, letter, or almost anything
			else, and each and every one of them turned out to be very humorous.

			<h2 class="textLessMargin">Ray Bradbury Essay</h2>
			<p class="footer">The first essay that I wrote focused on
				exploring the pieces, “August 2026: There Will Come Soft Rains” and
				“The Pedestrian” by Ray Bradbury. In these pieces Ray Bradbury
				criticizes the use of technology as an end-all be-all solution to
				many of the world’s problems and points out that no matter how
				advanced technology may get, it will never replicate true humanity.
				This is what I analyzed in this essay, and I ended up pointing out
				that while technology may initially seem to be helping humanity
				progress in a new direction, it may be used for purposes that were
				not originally intended, thus harming humanity in the long run. In
				this way, the progress of technology may end up being regress for
				humanity.</p>

			<h2 class="textLessMargin">Satirical Analysis Essay</h2>
			<p class="footer">The second essay shown here is an analysis of a
				satirical piece titled, "Scots Vote to Stay in UK; ‘Yes’ Voters to
				Be Hanged as Rebels." While we were given many options on how we
				could analyze the satire of our choosing, I chose to analyze how and
				why it failed in achieving its end goal. With this specific satire,
				I ended up agreeing that while there were some parts of the piece
				that were able to convey the message of the satire, overall the
				piece was still lacking the necessary information and writing style
				that would allow it to truly convince the reader to believe in their
				cause. In this case the author was ultimately unable to convey that
				Britain has been suppressing Scottish independence movements due to
				their overuse of sharp language and misuse of caricature. If you
				would like to read more about my analysis of the piece, the essay
				can be found on the right.</p>
