			Hello, I’m Daniel Kaminski, and thank you for visiting my website!
			I’m currently a junior at Mass Academy and in my spare time I enjoy
			weightlifting, hiking, playing video games and hanging out with my
			friends. I also play piano, do Boy Scouts, Kung Fu, tennis, and in
			the past I have also participated in 5 years of competitive
			gymnastics. The past two years I have had the privilege of going to
			my school science fair, regional fair, and even the <a

				target="_blank"> Massachusetts Fair,</a> in which I placed third
			last year! These have been great experiences and have exposed me to
			the world of competitive science. Throughout my life I have also
			gotten the opportunity to see some parts of the world and I have gone
			to Canada, Russia, Mexico, and the Dominican Republic. Now that you
			have learned a little bit about me, have fun exploring my website!

		<h2>Hiking</h2>
		<p>
			One of my favorite activities is hiking, camping, and exploring
			nature in general. A group that allows me to really get involved with
			nature and experience its beauty is the Boy Scouts program and
			specifically my group, <a href=https://www.troop182holden.org
				target="_blank">Troop 182.</a> Throughout the years I have
			participated in many hiking and camping adventures with this group.
			This ranges from a High Adventure trip to the Boundary Waters in
			Minnesota, to a simple sunset hike up Mount Wachusett, but each is
			memorable in its own way. One of my favorites is always the yearly
			mountain hike. The feeling when you summit the mountain and can see
			the beautiful view is indescribable, and I would recommend anyone to
			try hiking a mountain at some point in their life. Through scouts I
			have also learned to be respectful to nature, and to always “leave no
			trace”. Overall, the friends, experiences, and the fun times this
			program has provided me have been of infinite value.

		<h2>Music</h2>

			<p>I started piano when I was 5 and have not looked back since.
				Throughout the years I have gone from playing basic notes to
				full-length classical pieces. Thanks to my piano teacher I have
				learned many skills, including musical expression and sight-reading.
				Although I’m always nervous before my recitals, they're always a
				good time, and it’s a blast listening to other people’s performances
				of beautiful piano pieces. Piano has also taught me patience and
				persistence. Additionally, all throughout middle school and my first
				two years of highschool I played the clarinet. This provided me with
				the ability to play music as part of a band group, and taught me
				many important collaborative skills. Over time I have learned more
				and more about the world of music, and of course, I enjoy my fair
				share of listening to music as well.</p>

		<h2>Sports</h2>

			<p>
				Although I no longer do gymnastics, I did compete for 5 years. Each
				competitive meet was nerve-wracking, but every time I got to up to
				the podium and saluted the crowd made it all worth it. I had a great
				time going to <a href=http://sterlinggym.com/about/index.html
					target="_blank"> Sterling Gym</a> with my friends, and the huge
				amount of new skills that were there to learn made it a continuous
				challenge. Throughout my time doing gymnastics I learned so much
				about the community and had a great time interacting with others.
				After I stopped doing gymnastics I ended up picking up Kung Fu. I
				have moved up all the way to a purple with blue belt after attending
				the <a href=https://newenglandkungfu.com target="_blank">Kung Fu
					and Tai Chi Academy of New England</a> for now over 2 and a half years.
				This has been a great learning experience and has taught me
				discipline and the meaning of Kung Fu and other martial Arts. I have
				also occasionally played tennis in my free time as well as spending
				considerable time over the past two years weight lifting.

		<h2>Family</h2>
		<p>I live in Holden with my younger brother, mother, father, and
			cat Apricot. My paternal grandparents live in Holden as well, while
			my maternal grandma, aunt, and cousin live in Moscow, and below is an
			image of me and my brother when we visited them there. I also have an
			older brother that serves in the military and as such doesn't stay in
			same place for too long. My cat Apricot is a very cute Maine Coon
			cat, and he is very small and is only 1 year old. He has a unique
			talkativeness and he also likes taking walks outside.</p>
