		<h1>Physics</h1>
		<p class="newText textcenter">Physics with Mr. Ellis is a class
			that allows me and the other students to learn about the fundamental
			basics of kinematics, energy, momentum, forces, rotational motion,
			electricity and magnetism, as well as many other subjects. Every day
			was spent learning something new, and every problem that we solved
			felt unique and provided some new knowledge for us to further our
			conceptual understanding with. The never-ending challenge helped
			teach us to think critically about physics, as well as encouraging us
			to aspire to be creative in the often-analytical subject of physics.
			As a result of the knowledge that I have learned in physics, I now
			have a better understanding of the world that we live in. We began
			learning each subject through notes, and then moved into End of
			Chapter/EOC questions. These were more difficult but were more
			similar to the questions that we would find on the tests, so this
			allowed us to apply or knowledge of the subjects thus far so that we
			could more readily solve problems. After this there was usually a
			project or a LAB, and we then prepared the exams with some sample
			tests from previous years. We then had our final exam for every unit,
			and then it was onto the next unit! There was plenty of fun along the
			way, including but not limited to a variety of candy to pick from in
			class, as well as races to get to class before class started and the
			door was closed!</p>

			<h2 class="textLessMargin">Über-Rocket</h2>
			<p class="textLessMargin">The first example of the work that we
				did in physics that I have here is the Über-rocket problem. In many
				of the units that we have done, there is an Über problem. While not
				always the most challenging, they teach prudence as they usually
				contain many steps of calculations, so a single mistake can change
				the final result drastically. This particular example is the algebra
				version of our first Über problem, which involved finding the total
				displacement of an object through the use of multi-stage kinematics.
				In order to solve this problem I broke up the total calculation into
				many different sections, with the object acting differently in each.
				I was then able to complete the calculations for the first section,
				use those results to move onto the calculations for the second
				sections, etc., until I got my final answer. Then after this we were
				tasked with creating a double page write-up of our solution. This
				particular write-up allowed us to show how well we can concisely fit
				all of our work into a single double-page file while still
				containing all of the necessary information.</p>

			<h2 class="textLessMargin">Penny Drop Lab</h2>
			<p class="textLessMargin">The second example of my work is the
				lab-report from our first ever lab where we estimated
				the acceleration due to gravity on earth by timing the fall of a
				penny. In order to calculate the acceleration due to gravity, we
				were given some measuring materials and a penny. We then tried
				different setups, until we settled on a final one. After this we
				collected data about the time it took the penny to hit the ground
				from different heights. Using this data we were able to leverage the
				kinematic equations to calculate the acceleration due to gravity
				using both raw and linearized data. While my groups results were not
				necessarily the most accurate, this lab did teach our entire grade a
				valuable lesson, which is that there are always certain limitations
				to every experimental setup, and often times, human error is a large
				factor that should be minimized to the greatest extent possible. In
				addition to the data collection we also practiced being concise by
				creating a single page lab report, thus having to fit all of the
				information onto a small space.</p>
