		<h1>Language</h1>
		<p class="footer">In the language class with Mrs. Wildfong, I
			learned to be immersed in French, and to build upon my four years of
			previous French experience. In the intermediate French group, we
			learned about verb tenses, vocabulary, listening comprehension, and
			many other aspects of the French language. Throughout each term we
			were asked to complete a daily vocabulary log, which for B-term ended
			up having more than 250 words, as well as a bi-weekly listening log.
			Through both of these tasks, I learned to constantly be exposed to
			new French material. By interacting with my fellow classmates, I also
			learned to speak in French to those on the same level on me, as
			opposed to just those that have a more advanced understanding of the
			language. By only being allowed to speak French in class I was able
			to lose my dependency on English as a way of filling in gaps in my
			French knowledge. By doing everything in pure French, even things
			like watching movies, it was sometimes even difficult to switch back
			to English once class was over!</p>

			<h2 class="textLessMargin">Fairy Tale</h2>
			<p class="footer">This fairy tale was one of the B-term
				intermediate French assignments, and this allowed me to create a
				cohesive story in another language, which was a very useful
				experience. Since I was able to do this, I was able to be creative,
				so for my story I put a twist on a classic Russian fairy tale. In
				the end, I had a final product which was one of my first pieces of
				creative writing in another language. Writing creatively is not easy
				and doing so in a foreign language adds another interesting
				challenge to the process. It was great fun looking at other
				students' fairly tales and seeing what kinds of stories they could
				imagine.</p>

			<h2 class="textLessMargin">French Recipe</h2>
			<p class="textLessMargin">This assignment involved creating a
				recipe from a French speaking country, cooking it, bringing it to
				school for a buffet style lunch, and then finally creating a
				presentation to teach the class a little bit about how the dish is
				cooked. For my dish I ended up choosing to cook buckwheat crÃªpes
				with a cheese, egg, and spinach filling. As I don't often cook this
				assignment was definitely a new experience for me. It provided a
				unique challenge and allowed me to learn a little bit more about the
				gastronomy of other countries. Trying everyone else's food from
				French speaking countries all exposed me to many new cultural
				dishes, and allowed me to have an awesome lunch. Having French music
				playing in the background and eating a variety of French entrees,
				appetizers, and desserts was the most fun I've had being immersed in
				French culture so far!</p>

			<p class="textLessMargin">In language class, there is a annual
				school-wide meme competition near the end of A-term. This is a good
				introduction to the world of immersion French, and allows us to use
				our creativity while also working in French. It is a great
				assignment in the sense that it allows everyone to express their
				opinions of the classes and of the school so far in a comical way.

				you will find the same meme translated into English.</p>
