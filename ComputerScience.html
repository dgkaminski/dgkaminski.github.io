		<h1>Computer Science</h1>
		<p class="newText footer">Computer Science with Mrs. Taricco was
			my first introduction to computer science, and we ended up starting
			the year with an introduction to HTML and CSS. This is when we
			created our own personal websites, the updated version of which is
			what you are seeing right now! We then moved into learning Java, and
			this is what we spent a large amount of time doing throughout the
			year. From coding a program that checks the validity of credit card
			numbers, to a program that draws colorful stars in random positions
			(see below), the variety of assignments allowed for constant
			learning, creativity, and challenge to be major components of the
			class. All of this created an excellent introduction to coding, and
			class allowed everyone to learn, from those that had been coding most
			of their life to those like me who had never truly coded. It also
			allowed us to take a more computer science based view to problems as
			opposed to viewing them purely mathematically.</p>

		<p class="newText footer">The first assignment shown is a coded
			version of the Sieve of Eratosthenes. For this assignment we were
			tasked with using an array in order to simulate the sieve in java.
			What is interesting about this coding lab is that it allows for
			primes to be computed in a very quick way, and the particular method
			of prime calculations, when translated into java, allows for many
			possible points of optimization. For example, instead of having to
			run all the way through, the program only has to run until a certain
			point which is determined by the square root of the upper bound. The
			other interesting aspect of this way of computing primes is that it
			requires no division, and thus is a unique way of quickly finding
			many prime numbers in Java. A sample input and output are shown
			above. So when coding this problem, I included the optimizations
			listed above. You can see the code of the actual problem on the above
			right, and a sample output on the above left.</p>

		<h2 class=textLessMargin>Drawing Stars</h2>
		<p class="newText footer">This assignment was one of my favorites
			and was called “Drawing Stars”. Using a Java applets and the graphics
			method, the goal was to draw stars of random sizes, shapes, and
			colors within a certain area. The way that I ended up doing this is
			through the use of trigonometry and estimation of coordinates on two
			circles, each with the same center and difference radii. I also ended
			up using a lot of randomization, with the only input parameter being
			the amount of stars that should be drawn. When coding the problem in
			java, I used the random class to find the radius of the inner circle
			on which the inside three points were plotted, then used a random
			factor to the radius of the outer circle. By using trigonometry and
			shifting angle units, the points could be plotted on each of these
			circles that when used with the fillPolygon class would result in a
			filled star being formed. After this was coded in, I added a random
			coordinate offset, and a random color function. After doing all this
			I was left with a fun and unique way of combining something that is
			visually pleasing, with code and mathematics. Once again, a sample
			input that draws 50 stars is shown.</p>

			<h2 class=textLessMargin>Easter Sunday</h2>
			<p class="newText textcenter textLessMargin">For this assignment
				we were tasked with creating a java program that given a year
				parameter, could calculate the month and day that Easter falls on.
				To do this we were encouraged to use a very interesting formula
				created by Carl Gauss in the year 1800, which involved many
				mathematical operation all stemming of of just the initial year,
				which eventually gives two numeric values, one being the month that
				Easter Sunday falls on, and the other being the date. So in order to
				accurately determine the date, we had to complete many mathematical
				steps in java, and this taught us all a lesson in mathematical
				prudence, which if not followed, can lead to logic errors in code. I
				solved the problem by simply taking the year as an input, performing
				the formula calculations on it, and then displaying the resulting
				month and date. I ended up putting this assignment on my website
				because of unique it was and how incredible the formula itself is.</p>
