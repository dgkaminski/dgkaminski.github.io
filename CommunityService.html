			Camp</h2>
		<p class="newText footer">
			The first bit of community service that I did for MAMS was spent
			picking up trash around a Boy Scouts summer camp that I went to this
			summer. For me, this was a very meaningful experience. What I did,
			specifically, was pick up trash around <a
				href=https://hnebsa.org/camping/camp-wanocksett target="_blank">Camp
				Wanocksett </a> in New Hampshire. This made me realize how much trash
			people leave just laying around. This not only made me more aware of
			the situation but made me more likely to want it to change. This is
			why after I completed the service hours, I was still mindful of the
			trash situation at camp and did a trash sweep of the campground
			before I left. This service was a benefit to the community because it
			made the whole area cleaner and for the community of the scouts, this
			was a noticeable difference that simply improved the experience for
			everyone. It also kept the environment not only looking cleaner but
			kept the wildlife safe. I would recommend cleaning up a nature area
			to anyone that is willing to do it. This is because it not only is
			gratifying watching an area become cleaner because of your work, but
			because it also very nice knowing that other people might notice what
			you are doing and also think about how they can help. Overall, I did
			not spend much time working on this activity, so for me this was a
			short but meaningful activity.

				<p class="newText textcenter">My second series of community
					service work focused on volunteering at my local recycling center.
					This means lots of hard work, but also a very rewarding experience.
					I hate to see things that took effort and energy to manufacture go
					to waste without any good reason, and volunteering at the recycling
					center allowed me to do something to help fix this. I spent the
					majority of my time in the styrofoam department working on breaking
					down styrofoam, packaging it, and moving it into a container. This
					is harder than one might initially guess, as the styrofoam needs to
					be the correct size, type, and cleanliness. This helped me realize
					how many products use styrofoam that don't need it, and this was a
					very disheartening realization after personally seeing so much of
					it go to waste. However, I also saw many people come that were
					willing to make a difference in helping the world and my district,
					and this always made my day.</p>
