		<h1>Math Modeling</h1>
		<p class="newText footer">Mathematical Modeling with Mr. Regele
			was my first introduction to the world of competitive math as well as
			to the world of math modeling. Before I came to MAMS, I had never
			partaken in a mathematics competition or done any sort of creative
			problem solving. That all changed and I quickly learned the scope of
			both the applications of mathematics and the extent to which
			competitive mathematics can be taken. Throughout the year we
			consistently did assignments that encouraged us to build upon prior
			knowledge and find out ourselves what would often be given simply as
			a formula or a rule to memorize. This allowed me to understand math
			in a way that I never had before, allowing me to come up with my own
			unique solutions to problems. We also learned from Mr. Regele that
			while sometimes asking, "Why should I learn this if I am not going to
			use this in the real world?" may be useful, it is often okay to
			answer, "Because it's fun."</p>

				The first assignment that you will find here is my teams HiMC paper.
				<a
					href=https://www.comap.com/highschool/contests/himcm/2021problems.html
					target="_blank">HiMC</a> stands for High School Mathematical
				Contest in Modeling and is an annual two weeklong competition open
				to the entire United States, which allows students to join a group
				and write a paper as a response to a mathematical modeling prompt.
				However at MAMS our experience was a little bit different, as we had
				only 48 hours to work on our paper. As a result, while the
				experience was a bit hectic, many of the students agree that it is
				one of the most memorable experiences of the year. It allowed us all
				to learn something new and to tackle a very open-ended large-scale
				problem in our own way, building our own timeframe and making our
				own decisions. My group, which consisted of <a

					target="_blank">Rachel Bunsick,</a> and I, decided to tackle
				Problem B, which focused on simulating the water level of Lake Meade
				in order to find out if the level would one day become critically
				low. This is important as a large portion of the South-West, mainly
				parts of Arizona and Nevada, depend on the artificial lake as a
				water source. We chose this problem as when we had been practicing
				earlier working on modeling problems the week before, we ended up
				finding out that statistical analysis problems were more easily
				understandable to our team, and out of the two problems available
				that year, Problem B was based more on statistics than Problem A
				(both problems can be found at the link for the HiMC website near
				the beginning of this paragraph). In essentiality, in order to
				answer whether or not the water level of Lake Meade would become a
				problem in the future, we ended up creating a simulation that
				contained functions based off of past data to simulate what the
				water levels would look like in the future. By finding climate data
				for the region, as well as Colorado flow data on the <a
					href=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/cdo-web target="_blank">Climate
					Data Online</a> website, we were able to use theoretical inflow and
				outflow equations, as well as temperature data to model how the
				elevation of the lake would change over time. We were able to code a
				java program that used those equations that allowed us to conclude
				that if everything continued as it had been for the past 30 years,
				the water level would reach unsafe levels within the next 20 years.
				At the end of this experience, we wrote a paper on our solution to
				the problem, which was then submitted to the COMAP commission for
				review.

				<p class="newText footer">The second assignment that you are
					seeing here was given to us in late B-term which required us to
					find the least-square line of best fit for a set of data without
					using any pre-coded software features. This was a great learning
					experience as instead of simply accepting that a tool exists, we
					were able to pick apart the process by which the least-square line
					of best fit is generated, and using this knowledge, were able to
					apply this information to a set of data. After learning how to
					perform the calculations, we were tasked with creating a writeup of
					our solution in Mathematica in a way that was understandable,
					organized, and complete. This is what you can find to the left of
					this text. As with many Mathematica assignments in Mr. Regele's
					class, there was a large focus on visual data representation, which
					is why you will find many headings, sub-headings, graphs, and
					tables in the write-up.</p>

			<h2 class=textLessMargin>Epsilon School</h2>
			<p class="newText textLessMargin">This particular assignment was
				a group project. The goal of this project was to model the optimal
				departments for which to hire faculty, following an increase in
				student enrollment. This was one of the first experiences in the
				class of a problem that was not just multi-stepped, but rather
				something more open ended. As it was so open ended, we ended up
				having many different approaches in the class. It was interesting to
				listen to the presentations and find out how everyone approached the
				problem. In my group we decided on figuring out the population of
				the following year, and then scaling class enrollments for the next
				year using the previous years grade by grade class enrollment
				ratios. This then allowed us to find the classes that would have the
				highest student to teacher ratios the following year, and teachers
				were then assigned to those classes.</p>
